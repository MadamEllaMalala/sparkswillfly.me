- "Liam K., High School Student": "Before joining, I had never written any code in my life. Now, I can build and program my own robots! The instructors are so cool, and the robot competition is exciting. I can't wait to win my first robotics tournament with ’Sparks Will Fly’."
- "Ms. Ngoyi, Business Owner": "We invited ’Sparks Will Fly’ for a robotics demo event at headquarters, and the experience was amazing. The students were fully engaged, asking questions, and even got to try programming a robot. We will definitely host another event."
